R Labs for Introduction to Statistical Learning

Contains the computer labs for each chapter in the book Introduction to Statistical Learning with R.

The lab for each chapter is in a separate file.

The chapters cover linear regression, classification, model validation, general additive models, support vector machines, and unsupervised learning.

A few years ago I worked through the book and went through each lab to get acquainted with how R implements each of these topics. At the time I had much more experience with Matlab, and this exercise showed me the power of R.
