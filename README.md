R Labs for Introduction to Statistical Learning

Contains the computer labs for each chapter in the book Introduction to Statistical Learning.

The lab for each chapter is in a separate file.

The chapters cover linear regression, classification, model validation, general additive models, support vector machines, and unsupervised learning.

I went through each lab to get acquainted with how R implements each of these topics. I have experience with Matlab, and I am working to be proficient in R.
